AP Calculus AB is an introductory college-level calculus course. Students cultivate their understanding of differential and integral calculus through engaging with real-world problems represented graphically, numerically, analytically, and verbally and using definitions and theorems to build arguments and justify conclusions as they explore concepts like change, limits, and the analysis of functions. Shannon, from my experience with you, the three words I would use to describe you are responsive, adaptable, collaborative. Shannon, you always turn in homework, and I applaud your dedication to the course! You work very well in small and large groups, I see that you are excited to share your ideas infront of the class. I think you are a stellar example of what participation should look like in class.Shannon, you show a basic level of understanding, but you definitely have some work to do. Your scores are not very impressive, with C's on most tests, and scoring a 72 on the final. I highly recommend that you stop by my office to do some 1-on-1 meetings with me, as I think you would benefit greatly. Also, if you have any questions, feel free to email me or classmates for help. The jump from Precalc to Calc AB is significant and you have smoothly transitioned. With the work you have put into the this class, you recieve a final grade of B, good job!
